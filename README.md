# Donate

I'm making tools like this in my free time, but since I don't have much of it, I can't give all of them the proper attention.

If you like this tool, you consider it useful or it made you life easier, please do not hesitate to thank/encourage me to continue working on it with any amount you see fit. (You know, buy me a cup of coffee / gallon of lemonade / 5-course gourmet dish / whatever you think I deserve ðŸ™‚)
